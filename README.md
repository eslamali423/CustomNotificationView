This may include customizing options such as fonts, background colors, text colors, sounds, vibrations, and animations for different types of notifications.

```swift
import UIKit
import CustomNotificationView

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        return true
    }
}

  /// Font for the notification message.
  config.messageFont = .systemFont(ofSize: 14, weight: .medium)
```
---
### Background Colors

  /// Title text color for error notification title. Default is custom red.
  config.errorTitleTextColor = .systemRed
```

```            
  /// - CustomNotificationViewSound Parameters:
  ///   - soundName: The name of the custom sound file.
  ///   - soundExtension: The extension of the custom sound file (e.g., "mp3", "wav").
  /// Specifies a custom sound for success notifications.
  config.successNotificationSound = CustomNotificationViewSound(soundName: "successSound", soundExtension: "mp3")
  /// Specifies a custom sound for warning notifications.
  config.warningNotificationSound = CustomNotificationViewSound(soundName: "warningSound", soundExtension: "mp3")
  /// Specifies a custom sound for error notifications.
   config.errorNotificationSound = CustomNotificationViewSound(soundName: "successSound", soundExtension: "mp3")
```
